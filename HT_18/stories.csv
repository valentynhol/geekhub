I really wish I can get people&#x27;s feedback on the tool itself.<p>About Jig:<p>Jig is a live coding environment to quickly create interactive business dashboards &#x2F; small internal apps.<p>My target customers are growing startups who spend too much time in Excel&#x2F;Google Sheets to create their growth reports &#x2F; retention charts &#x2F; ad hoc analyses, while they have the coding expertise to compute metrics with a proper programming language.<p>The language is Javascript, but you don&#x27;t need to know any html&#x2F;css&#x2F;d3 for charts or tables, cause all that part&#x27;s taken care of. Connecting to databases and or APIs is also straightforward, so all you need to write is code that transform your data in the way you want to present it.<p>It&#x27;s meant to be light and nimble (no server &#x2F; no database needed) and it runs on your computer.<p>Sorry for those who&#x27;ve seen this before, I won&#x27;t repost soon.<p>[0] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29655974"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=29655974</a>"

It includes a built-in frontend data model, Vue.js-like rendering, built-in AJAX integration, and a full component&#x2F;library system.<p>It is also <i>fully scriptable</i> from your backend AJAX handlers.  Anything that Hibiki HTML can do on the frontend can be done with a remote handler by returning specially formatted JSON <i>actions</i>.  This allows you to write frontend logic (that would normally be JavaScript code) in your backend handlers.<p>Background -- Hibiki HTML is a standalone, open-source, more powerful version of the frontend language that I had built for my internal tools startup Dashborg over the past year.  It is a reaction against the extreme amount of scaffolding and configuration required to set up a new frontend project, especially when you&#x27;re a backend&#x2F;devops&#x2F;data engineer who isn&#x27;t a JavaScript expert.  As more Hibiki libraries are written, the advantages will hopefully become even more clear.<p>I&#x27;d love to get all of your feedback, questions, and comments.  Would love a star on Github if you like the idea.  Also, feel free to email me, and&#x2F;or join the Slack workspace I set up (contact info on Github or the tutorial)."

That proved to be more difficult than expected and I had to relent and take a peak at existing implementations to fill in some important gaps. I&#x27;ve documented my struggles and learnings in the README for others to benefit from.<p>I also wanted to solidify my understanding of TensorFlow&#x2F;Keras and learn PyTorch, so I made sure to implement the model in both. Faster R-CNN is fairly challenging in that it doesn&#x27;t quite map to Keras tutorial examples. For example, losses are not computed simply as a function of model output and input but rather, some of the training data is actually computed on-the-fly within the model during training and the losses have to explicitly be constructed as part of the graph.<p>Personally, I found the &quot;official&quot; TensorFlow reference implementation (<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tensorflow&#x2F;models&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;research&#x2F;object_detection&#x2F;meta_architectures&#x2F;faster_rcnn_meta_arch.py"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;tensorflow&#x2F;models&#x2F;blob&#x2F;master&#x2F;research&#x2F;ob...</a>) to be very difficult to follow and I hope this proves to be useful to learners like myself."

Playwright got a lot of love on HN today [1] - rightfully so, it&#x27;s an incredible project! - so I thought I&#x27;d resubmit [2] an open-source project that lets you run load tests with existing Playwright scripts.<p>GitHub link: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;artilleryio&#x2F;artillery-engine-playwright<p>The basic motivation for creating the project is that load testing complex web apps is a real pain in the ass. It takes ages to build out test scripts for a non-trivial web app with traditional API-oriented tools. If you&#x27;ve ever had to do it, you know how frustrating it can be.<p>So we thought, why not try load testing with real browsers instead? Especially if we can just reuse existing E2E testing scripts we already have? (based on Playwright of course!) Turns out it can work very well.<p>Is load testing with real browsers expensive? Yes, sort of - relative to more traditional load testing. This project lets you max out developer productivity points at the cost of... well, cost. But! developer time is expensive! And cloud compute is cheap - running 1,000 4 vCPU&#x2F;12GB RAM containers on AWS Fargate for an entire hour is going to cost ~$220 in Fargate fees for example.<p>The project is still in its early days, would love any feedback! &lt;3<p>1. https:&#x2F;&#x2F;news.ycombinator.com&#x2F;item?id=30083042

Nectr is a service that lets IT professionals easily create a free, sharable profile that accurately captures your skills, experience and availability. With this functionality &quot;in the can&quot;, we&#x27;re in midst of extending our service to let you create a genuine, uncontrived network of colleagues that you&#x27;ve actually worked with and who can accurately confirm your skills and experience. These confirmations will form the edges in our graph that comprise your first degree network.<p>As a long time freelancer, I started working on Nectr to fill a requirement that I&#x27;ve long had: ditching my Word-formatted résumé for good—and automatically answering the oft-asked question: &quot;Are you available?&quot;. Existing options (LinkedIn, StackOverflow, JSON resume, etc.) just don&#x27;t fit the bill.<p>How is Nectr different than the alternatives?<p>- Your profile (example here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;nectr.pub&#x2F;12507&#x2F;matthew.mcneely) is completely open—the viewer does not need to have an account on Nectr. You can also append .json to the end of your profile URL to get a machine-friendly version. The ability to maintain your profile will always be free.<p>- Your skills and platform knowledge are bound to entries in our knowledge graph of IT skills and platforms. This has (obvious?) advantages over the simple keyword tags used in most other services.<p>- Our concept of availability is extremely granular. For instance, you can set an availability for a certain rate, or engagement type or zip code. In other words, we know that availability isn&#x27;t binary. Further, we know that people can have multiple availabilities. For example, you might be willing to work on freelance crypto projects up to 10 hours a week after hours, but also might be open to a full time job close to your home.<p>- If you hate our UI (hey, we get it), we&#x27;ll soon open up our GraphQL API so you can maintain your profile programmatically.<p>We&#x27;re currently in preview release (aka unfunded!), so we&#x27;re limiting the number of accounts while we work out the kinks.
